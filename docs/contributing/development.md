# Development

If you're interested in contributing to the development of loadbot, here are a few things you'll need to set up:

1. Install Golang: loadbot is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. Install GoReleaser: GoReleaser is used for releasing Go projects. You can install it using Go itself:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest
   ```

This section outlines the basic requirements for setting up your development environment for loadbot. Feel free to add more details or specific instructions as needed.
