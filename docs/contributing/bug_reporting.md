# Reporting a Bug

If you encounter any bugs or issues while using loadbot, we encourage you to report them so that we can address them promptly. Here's how you can report a bug effectively:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting a new bug, please check the existing issues on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/kuzxnia/loadbot/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported by someone else.

2. **Provide Details**: When reporting a bug, provide as much detail as possible about the issue you're experiencing. Include information such as:
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Any error messages or logs you encountered
   - Your operating system and loadbot version
   - loadbot version: You can find this information by running `loadbot -v` in your terminal.
   - System version: Include information about your operating system version (e.g., macOS 10.15.7, Ubuntu 20.04).

3. **Create a New Issue**: If you couldn't find an existing issue that matches your problem, create a new issue on the GitHub issue tracker. Be sure to give your issue a clear and descriptive title and include all relevant information in the description.

4. **Follow Up**: Once you've reported the bug, feel free to follow up on the issue thread if you have additional information or if there are any updates on the bug.

By following these steps, you'll help us identify and address bugs in loadbot more efficiently, improving the overall quality of the tool for everyone.
