# loadbot 

## Introduction

Loadbot is a workload driver designed to simulate heavy loads on systems for performance testing and benchmarking purposes. It allows users to generate various types of workloads to stress-test their systems under different scenarios.

This code, being an open-source project, is in its early development stage and likely contains various bugs. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve loadbot, make it more robust and reliable, and introduce new features.
